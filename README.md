<img src="public/img/readme/0.png" />

This project has as a principle to communicate to the developers about the workshops and conferences that will be given at the event in the two days established for this purpose. For the event will be given to registered developers the opportunity to purchase different plans, being these the free pass with basic gifts, the onsite pass which is the most complete and the virtual pass with more benefits than the free one but less than the onsite one. The project has a public area for those who will attend the event and an administration area to manage the page and all the movements made on it.
The project was built with the MVC structure, mostly with PHP language, JavaScript was also used for small functionalities and also to build an API to query the database through Fetch API. The MySQL database consists of different tables to store data such as: the registration of those who will attend the conferences (mail, personal information), the workshops and conferences, the method of payment.
